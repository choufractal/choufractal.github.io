# Hello!

After 5 years as Head of ML research at Sonos, I took the lead on a strategic strike in the Summer 2023 and I am now Head of Automatic Speech Recognition, owning every speech-to-text component of Sonos Voice Control, from research to production. I am lucky to work with a team of around 60 extremely talented and passionate people in our R&D department in Paris. 

My main mission is to deliver state-of-the-art speech recognition models for the future generation of Sonos Voice Control, tailored to the Sonos ecosystem, and fit for embedded inference as a safeguard to user privacy. I continue working consistently to promote a fruitful and ambitious scientific research environment in the machine learning team that boosts and supports our production goals. 

On June 1st 2022, after several yearks of work, we released _Sonos Voice Control_: an on-device voice control interface on Sonos speakers, putting speed accuracy and privacy on an equal footing. You can find more details in this [post](https://tech-blog.sonos.com/posts/on-device-voice-control-on-sonos-speakers/) on Sonos Tech Blog.

I hold a PhD in statistical physics from the École Normale Supérieure (Paris) since 2016. I focused on high-dimensional inference with graphical models in the context of protein structure prediction.
