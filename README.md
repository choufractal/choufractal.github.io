# Hello!

I am the Head of Machine Learning Research at Sonos, focusing on privacy-first speech recognition for voice experiences. I was previously the Director of Machine Learning Research at Snips (acquired by Sonos in November 2019) that I joined in February 2017. I am lucky to work with a team of around 60 extremely talented and passionate people in our R&D department "Sonos Voice Experience" in Paris. 

On June 1st 2022, after several yearks of work, we released _Sonos Voice Control_: an on-device voice control interface on Sonos speakers, putting speed accuracy and privacy on an equal footing. You can find more details in this [post](https://tech-blog.sonos.com/posts/on-device-voice-control-on-sonos-speakers/) on Sonos Tech Blog.

Prior to joining Snips, I was a PhD student at the theoretical physics lab of the École Normale Supérieure (Paris). I focused on high-dimensional inference with graphical models in the context of protein structure prediction.
