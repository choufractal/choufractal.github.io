# Hello!

I am the Head of Machine Learning Research at Sonos, focusing on privacy-first speech recognition for voice experiences. I was previously the Director of Machine Learning Research at Snips (acquired by Sonos in November 2019) that I joined in February 2017. I am lucky to work with a team of around 60 extremely talented and passionate people in our R&D department "Sonos Voice Experience" in Paris.

Prior to joining Snips, I was a PhD student at the theoretical physics lab of the École Normale Supérieure (Paris). I focused on high-dimensional inference with graphical models in the context of protein structure prediction.
