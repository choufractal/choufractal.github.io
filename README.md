# Alice Coucke

I am Head of Machine Learning Research at Sonos, focusing on privacy-first speech recognition for voice experiences. I was previously Director of Machine Learning Research at Snips (acquired by Sonos in November 2019) that I joined in February 2017.

Prior to joining Snips, I was a PhD student at the theoretical physics lab of the École Normale Supérieure (Paris). I focused on high-dimensional inference with graphical models in the context of protein structure prediction.

## Current

At Sonos (and previously Snips), we consider the problem of automatic speech recognition on the edge, e.g. on small devices typical of IoT applications, with privacy in mind. I filed 3 patents currently under review. I have worked on several topics in automatic speech recognition: fairness in automatic speech recognition, keyword spotting in the context of wake word detectors, natural language understanding, sentence generation, etc.

## PhD

I pursued my PhD under the supervision of Rémi Monasson and Martin Weigt at the lab of theoretical physics of the École Normale Supérieure (Paris). I focused on maximum entropy graphical model inference and its application to genomic data, especially protein structure prediction. I discussed the extension of these approaches to other challenging fields, such as sequence folding prediction and homology detection. Through an extensive study on both artificial and biological data, I provided a better interpretation of the central inferred parameters, up to then poorly understood. I presented a new and more precise procedure for the inference of generative models, which lead to further improvements on real, finitely sampled data.

## Other

In January 2018, I took part in the DAT-ICU datathon for intensive care, aiming at presenting a clinical project using the MIMIC database (data about 50 000 intensive care unit patients). We proposed to associate a clinical print to each patient stay, allowing for instance to identify clusters of similar patients in a non supervised approach. We presented an algorithm of clinical data (textual and numerical) dimensionality reduction based on deep learning techniques.
My team won the first prize.

During my master 2, I worked at the "Physico-Chimie" lab of the Institut Curie under the supervision of Jean-François Joanny. I developed a theoretical model based on active gel theory and performed numerical simulations to study the effect of cell migration on morphogenesis in biological tissues.
